# RootKit_hide_processes
An implementation for a rootkit to hide processes by their name in linux (Ubuntu) works on ps and pstree.
The rootkit checks of the read file is a directory of a process. 
if it is he checks for the name of the process, if the name is matching he hides the process directory
Note this rootkit is unstable and can cuase problems to the OS.
